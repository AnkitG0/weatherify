# To-Do:

6/7/2025:
1) Find why weather cannot be displayed
 - The issue seems to be only for the city of London. Weather from other cities is being displayed correctly. To investigate later
2) Why are song recommendations not seen on the webpage
 - Issue was because the api result did not have parameter 'track' but rather 'tracks' - fixed and now getting propper recommendation now.
